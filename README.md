My goal for this web portfolio is allowing outsiders to get a sense of what design skills I am capable of. Of course you submit your resume when you apply for a job but that mainly consists of written material explaining your past experiences, skills, education, etc.. With a portfolio, it brings the resume to life. You can say you have an eye for design but your style might be different than what an employer is looking for. A portfolio allows the employer to see what your design is. I want my portfolio to show an array of designs so an employer can see that I am capable of adjusting to different brands. # webportfolio
