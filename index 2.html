        <p>
            My name is Grace Papa and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh striving towards a Communication and Rhetoric Degree with certificates in Digital Media, Corporate & Community Relations, and Public & Professional Writing. I am highly involved in the world of media both in and out of school. Some of my work can be viewed on the <a href="#my-work">My Work</a> page.
            I am currently working as a part-time intern on the marketing team for a residential company called Walnut Capital, a continuation of my full-time internship this past summer. My role focuses on a shopping mall owned and operated by Walnut Capital called Bakery Square. Here, we host a number of events such as yoga, free kids activities, holiday parties, you name it! I am primarily in charge of coordinating these events. Along with this, I also operate their social media platforms. I am passionate about media creation and am working towards aiming more of my roles towards that profession.

            <br>
            My interests include yoga, traveling, attending concerts, painting, spending time with family, trying new restaurants, and going to the beach. I am a DIE HARD Pitt fan and love attending the football games! I pride myself on having an outgoing and adventurous personality, and I try to surround myself with people that share the same eagerness. I hope this brief summary of what I do and what I enjoy gives you a better sense of who I am, both personally and professionally. Thanks for reading!
